# Large SQL payload replication

Two servers replicate 250 small rows and one 1.5 MiB bound text value. The receiver must return every row and the exact full payload through both the query protocols.

Each node is a separate `murmur-server` process. Application operations use
the `goharness` SQL client over the PostgreSQL wire protocol;
these tests do not open an embedded database.

Run from the repository root:

```sh
MURMUR_ENGINE_INTEGRATION=1 ./tests-live/run.sh large-payload
```

The process harness builds `murmur-server` and `murmur-admin` with the
`replication` feature, or reuses `MURMUR_SERVER_BIN` and `MURMUR_ADMIN_BIN`
(the admin binary defaults to a sibling of the server). `MURMUR_LIVE_RUNTIME`
selects the parent directory for unique per-test runtime folders. Successful
tests remove their runtime folders; failures retain the config and server logs
at the path printed in the test output.

The payload is 1.5 MiB; this is a correctness test rather than a throughput benchmark.
