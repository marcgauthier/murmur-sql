# SQL key rotation and crash recovery

Rotate the encryption key through the Rust client and kill the server immediately after the acknowledged command. Reopen using the new key, reject the old key, verify existing data, write more data, and restart again.

Each node is a separate `murmur-server` process. Application operations use
the `goharness` SQL client over the PostgreSQL wire protocol;
these tests do not open an embedded database.

Run from the repository root:

```sh
MURMUR_ENGINE_INTEGRATION=1 ./tests-live/run.sh rekey
```

The process harness builds `murmur-server` and `murmur-admin` with the
`replication` feature, or reuses `MURMUR_SERVER_BIN` and `MURMUR_ADMIN_BIN`
(the admin binary defaults to a sibling of the server). `MURMUR_LIVE_RUNTIME`
selects the parent directory for unique per-test runtime folders. Successful
tests remove their runtime folders; failures retain the config and server logs
at the path printed in the test output.

The kill tests acknowledged key rotation durability. It does not inject a crash at every internal rewrap instruction.
